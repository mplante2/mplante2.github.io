***Note*:** *This assignment practices working with Data Frame using Base R.*

***How to do it?***: 

- Open the Rmarkdown file of this assignment ([link](fa2020_assignment3.Rmd)) in Rstudio. 

- Right under each **question**, insert  a code chunk (you can use the hotkey `Ctrl + Alt + I` to add a code chunk) and code the solution for the question. 

- `Knit` the rmarkdown file (hotkey: `Ctrl + Alt + K`) to export an html.  

-  Publish the html file to your Githiub Page. 

***Submission***: Submit the link on Github of the assignment to Blackboard under Assignment 4. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE)
```

-------

#### 1. Install `tidyverse` package

An R package can be installed by `install.packages` function. Install `tidyverse` if you have not done so. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('tidyverse')
```

-------

#### 2. Read the data using `read_csv`

Use `read_csv` function to import the US Covid 19 data at [link](https://covidtracking.com/data/download/all-states-history.csv).  Don't forget to import `tidyverse` (library(tidyverse)) so that you can use read_csv. 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv('https://covidtracking.com/data/download/all-states-history.csv')
```

-------

#### 3.  Fix the date and ceate some new variables

- Use the following codes to change the type of the `date` column to `date`. 

```{r}
library(lubridate)
df$date <- ymd(df$date)
```

- Use the below codes to create `month`, `weekday` and `monthday` variables

```{r}

df$month = month(df$date)

# day of the week
df$weekday = wday(df$date)

# day of the month
df$monthday <- mday(df$date)
```

-------

#### 4. Create new variables with `case_when`. 

The function `case_when` is a good option to create a new variable from existing variable.  For example, this below codes create a new variable, `daily_death`, from `deathIncrease` variable.  `deathIncrease` is the number of daily new death by Covid19.  The new variable `daily_death` takes three values:  low (if `deathIncrease` less than 3), medium (`deathIncrease` from 3 to 14), and high (`deathIncrease` more than 14).  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
df$daily_death <- case_when(
  df$deathIncrease <3 ~ 'low',
  df$deathIncrease <=14 ~ 'medium',
  TRUE ~ 'high'
)
```

- Create variable `month2` that takes three values: early_month (day of the month from 1-10), mid_month (day of the month from 11-20), and end_month (day of the month > 20).
```{r}
df$month2 <- case_when(
  df$monthday <11 ~ 'early_month',
  df$monthday <21 ~ 'mid_month',
  TRUE ~ 'end_month')
```

-------

#### 5. Select function

Use the select function to deselect the column `totalTestsViral` from the data.
```{r}
df <- select(df, -totalTestsViral)
```

-------

#### 6. Pipe Operator ( %>% )

Pipe operator offers another way to write R codes. Many times, it makes the codes more readable.  Pipe works very well with all the `tidyverse` packages. Refer to [these slides](file:///C:/Users/sonou/Dropbox/git/math421/slides/dplyr.html#15) (slide 15, 16, 17 and 18) to rewrite the below codes using pipe operator

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- c(1:10)

# square root of x
sqrt(x)

sum(sqrt(x))

log(sum(sqrt(x)))

# log base 2 of 16
log(16, 2)

```
```{r}
x <- c(1:10)
x %>% sqrt
x %>% sqrt %>% sum
x %>% sqrt %>% sum %>% log
16 %>% log(2)
```

-------

#### 7. Combo 1: group_by + summarise

This combo is used when you want to apply a function/calculation to different groups of the data. For example, to calculate the average number of cases (`positiveIncrease`) by `dataQualityGrade`, we use:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
df %>% 
  group_by(dataQualityGrade) %>% 
  summarise(mean(positiveIncrease))
```

- Calculate the median number of cases (`positiveIncrease`) by `dataQualityGrade`
```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(dataQualityGrade) %>% 
  summarise(median(positiveIncrease))
```

- Calculate the maximum number of cases (`positiveIncrease`) by `dataQualityGrade`
```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(dataQualityGrade) %>% 
  summarise(max(positiveIncrease))
```

- Calculate the average number of cases (`positiveIncrease`) by `month2`
```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(month2) %>% 
  summarise(mean(positiveIncrease))
```

- Calculate the average number of cases (`positiveIncrease`) by `weekday`
```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(weekday) %>% 
  summarise(mean(positiveIncrease))
```

-------

#### 8. Combo 2: filter + group_by + summarise

An example: to calculate the average number of cases (`positiveIncrease`) by `dataQualityGrade` in RI, we use:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
df %>% 
  filter(state=='RI')
  group_by(dataQualityGrade) %>% 
  summarise(mean(positiveIncrease))
```

- Calculate the total number of new cases for each weekdays in MA
```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(state=='MA') %>%
  group_by(weekday) %>% 
  summarise(mean(positiveIncrease))
```

- Calculate the total number of new cases by `month2` in RI and MA.  Is there any difference between the total number of cases for each categories in `month2`? 
```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(state %in% c('RI','MA')) %>% 
  group_by(month2) %>% 
  summarise(mean(positiveIncrease))
#There are more cases for mid_month than early or end.
```

- Compare the average number of new cases between New England and the other states? 
```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(state %in% c('RI', 'CT', 'MA', 'ME','VT', 'NH')) %>% 
  summarise(mean(positiveIncrease))
```
